# Commerce_Data_Usability_Project

This repo is QMSS's contribution for the Commerce Data Usability Project.
Let's use the READ_ME file as a timeline, keeping a record of our contributions over time.
If you're adding a file just insert your name, date, and a small intro to a recent contribution:

*1/27*  
Jonathan Campbell: Created GitHub repo and added the READ_ME file

*1/28*
Steve Lee: Added data table Shiny application. Download the server.R and ui.R into a folder along with the data sets (currently the data table includes only the commodity flows and foreign trade data). Once you have all the files in a single folder, open up ui.R in Rstudio and just click 'run app'. It should work.... >_>
This is just a start - Please feel free to edit and add datasets and other functionalities, or just let me know and I can add them.
